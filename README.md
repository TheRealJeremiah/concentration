Implement a simplistic version of the Concentration game.

Requirements:
- Single player
- Single, standard deck of 52 cards, no wild-cards
- Programming language of your choice, but we are a RoR + JavaScript shop. 

Rules:
Randomly shuffle card deck, and lay out 22 cards, face down, on the play space. In each turn, player chooses two cards to turn over. If those cards have a matching face-value (number), the player scores a point. If the cards do not match, the player scores -1 point. Negative points are allowed. Upon a successful match, replace the two cards with two cards randomly chosen from the remaining card deck. Game is over when there are no more cards left to play.

Negative points are allowed.
Aces have a numeric value of “1”
Matched cards are discarded
